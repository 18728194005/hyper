hyper/http20/stream
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Objects that make up the stream-level abstraction of hyper's HTTP/2.0 support.

These objects are not expected to be part of the public HTTP/2.0 API: they're
intended purely for use inside hyper's HTTP/2.0 abstraction.

Conceptually, a single HTTP/2.0 connection is made up of many streams: each
stream is an independent, bi-directional sequence of HTTP headers and data.
Each stream is identified by a monotonically increasing integer, assigned to
the stream by the endpoint that initiated the stream.
